####Use Cases

###Scenarios

<b>A couple of friends want to do commentary of a sports game:</b>
		
There is a large sports event coming up and a group of friends really want to watch and  talk about it together. However, they are all across the world in different places for their own reasons. They can use kord.io to create their own personal board and stream their favorite game. They can use a smooth embedded chat on the website or start a voice chat.

<b>A TA/Professor wants to hold a screencast:</b>

The instructor can invite their students into a private board for a video lecture. This can be a pre-recorded lecture and be uploaded to the board during which the students can discuss the material chatting with each other. It can also be a live lecture, where the instructor organizes a time for the students to meet and then streams the lecture live on one of our boards.

<b>Students doing Peer to Peer Essay editing:</b>

Students can upload their essay and sources to a board and invite their friends to join and comment on their work. Editing will be dynamic and users will be able to make suggestions by commenting directly on files, track changes, and communicate through voice or text.

<b>A group of GUI Developers Contributing to a design:</b>

Users will be able to work on images together with kord.ioâ€™s dynamic drawing capabilities, as they simultaneously edit and discuss a particular interface or design. They will also be able to code together with context highlighting for hundreds of languages.

<b>A presenter shows his ideas to board of executives:</b>
 
Users will be able to create presentations on kord.io in formats such as powerpoint or keynote to show off ideas to potential donaters and investors. Much like google presentations this will also be easily shareable and presentable with multiple users.

<b>Gaming Team Strategizing:</b>

A group of friends are preparing for a large tournament and they want to quickly and easily share spreadsheets and make diagrams for the game. They will be able to have their own board with various types of material as well as voice communicate in the background during the game.

<b>Large Team Organization:</b>

Project managers can create multiple boards linked to each other and assign members to specific tasks while managing and controlling the communication between them. They will be able to give rights to different members that are responsible for various jobs and documents to make working together in a large team smooth and efficient.

<b>Mobile device Accessibility:</b>

Users will be able to use kord.io on various devices regardless of proccessing power and screen resolution. The web app will detect the system settings of a connection and display in various formats. A developer might unexpectedly run into someone interested in their idea and they want to be able to access their board from anywhere without needing a computer.
