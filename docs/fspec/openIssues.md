##Open Issues


###Open Issues include:
	How many members to limit a session
		Having to think about how much activity each member can perform in a session with x other members, finding a balance for limiting the number of members to a session will be left to trial and error.
	
	How handling session saving
		We want users to be able to save a session in some way, at first we may start with saving the board as a pdf then maybe eventually move to saving the board state.
	
	Layout for users with different resolutions
		A big issue is figuring out how to handle users running our app on different resolutions. Whether we want a static window with scrolling or screen pulling, or a resizable window.
	
	How much customization of tools and GUI to allow
		We want to give our users as much freedom as possible while keeping our UI very simple to operate, so deciding how much freedom to give to users will be an issure for trial and error.
	
	Layering the board
		With multiple users means that we will run into a layering issue when multiple people interact with the board, deciding who gets priority and synchronization.
	
	Exploit prevention
		Making sure our app is less prone to exploits.
