## Overview (v1.3)  

Kord is a centralized hub for human interaction over a digital medium,
whether that be for friends, businesses, working partners, social groups, etc.
Users will be able to chat and communicate in a room with an interactive board.
Resources such as documents, videos, etc. can be placed onto the board.
It can be drawn on. It can be used as a space for saving important links,
brainstorming, making timelines, and more.

It is a space where digital interactions have a sense of continuity and connect
people to each other, rather than to the ether.
