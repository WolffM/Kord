<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

After having pooled our team's classes inside and outside the major, we have come to realize that many of these classes involve some kind of
collaboration and/or communication need, but more importantly an environment that promotes it. Classes that demands to be recognized includes
CS320, CS377, Critical Thinking, all English classes, and on a more general note, all classes in the University. Having taken these classes,
we were introduced to many methods of communication, including Piazza, Moodle, Git, Google Docs, and Email to name a few. This is a great set of
availability for communication and collaboration but they do not provide an excellent substitute for a physical meeting.

In CS320, the focus was on planning over programming, which meant a lot of team interaction needed to place, where ideas, communication,
and decisions must be made in real time. A major problem manifested from meet-up availability, because of school scheduling not everyone was able
to meet at anytime and anywhere. As a result, meetings were held very late in the day, with emphasis on stress for off-campus students to make the
trip to school. CS377 had a similar problem where planning and scheduling posed a big problem that available programs could not completely solve
and this overflowed into our ability to code. Google Docs facilitated the process greatly, however it still left some things to be desired.

In other courses like Critical Thinking, and all levels of English courses, collaboration of ideas is crucial to the effectiveness of the class.
Students loved to talk about what they wanted to write about, they wanted ways to exchange ideas, get peer-to-peer editing on their work, and a
general want to present their paper to someone for some kind of feedback. A problem was the process to do so at the time, was almost non-existent.
There was no environment for collaboration unless at the class physically, and only if time is spared specifically for that reason.

Then generally, all classes provide the option for office hours with TAs or the professor, with specific time and a location. This also provided
a great way for questions to be answered, however scheduling became a problem once again, and once again no environment to hold effective office
hours online. A more pressing problem was office space, TA and professors simply did not have enough space in their office to handle number of
students that wanted to attend.

People want an environment that promotes sharing of ideas, interaction with one another, ease of access, and flexibility. Previous courses,
if not all, have shown a need for such a platform. An application that will incorporate the video and text messaging of Skype, the board of Trello,
the real-time collaboration of Google docs, and a collaborative "table" all into one easy to use platform. Being able to remove the hassle of
micromanaging different programs for different functions will greatly streamline a meeting, announcement, group project, or just a friendly hangout.
The team at kord.io will introduce a web application platform that will take the big step in tearing down the dividing line between digital and
physical meetings and promote an environment for unhindered collaboration and communication.

<h2>Product Description</h2>
//Work in progress.

<p align = "right"><i >[Written by  Julian Kuk - 10/02/2014]</em></p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
**Research**  
***Oct 1 - Oct 15***

This step will mostly consist of figuring out what is possible in low and high level design as far as the idea for our project goes. We plan on implementing web sockets to handle most of the interaction between server and client and as we learn more about other tools we will be able to finalize design in the document.

**Requirement Specifications**  
***Oct 16 - Oct 23***

Here we will define exactly what scope for the project will be. This includes specific use cases for extraneous situations that can could cause the project to fail. This document offers to describe what we are doing, not how it will be done. 

**Basic Interface**  
***Oct 24 - Oct 31***

By this step we plan to have all design completed and have basic groundwork completed for a server capable of receiving and sending requests. Here we will handle all interaction between client with respect to account management and tracking users.

**Full Functionality**	  
***Nov 1 - Nov 15***

All upload and download utilities should be working properly with a very basic way to view these changes. This step focuses on managing data on the server, keeping things dynamic and sustainable.

**Graphic Design**  
***Nov 16 - Nov 30***

After the functionality of the project are complete we will work on the visual appeal and the usability of the project. This step is very important since social media interfaces need to be appealing and easy to use to be useful for a large demographic of users.

**Testing and Refinement**  
***Dec 1 - Dec 4***

Here we will finalize our project and sort out any residual bugs and unexpected crashing that is still occurring. We will also create a presentation to show our finalized product.
