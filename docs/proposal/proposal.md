<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
	
With the migration of lifestyles from physical to digital, so have the way that people choose to meet with others. With the digital age, people can now communicate and interact with many people from across the world. The options for anyone to meet up over the internet is becoming more and more accessible and practical as applications on the internet further develops. The popularity of being able to meet up anywhere, anytime is becoming a more and more attractive prospect to users of all categories. To fill the needs of internet meetings, many have turned to Skype for video chatting and text chatting, Trello for project organization, and Google Docs for writing collaborations.

All are great platforms for any group to get together for almost anything, however they can take away from the group user experience because they are separate platforms. The separation can be very tedious when you want to have Skype video chat for communication and Trello for visual collaborations or want Trello and Google docs up to keep work and organization streamlined. A centralized collaboration feature can be very hard to find, a great example is Google Docs which does an excellent job at collaborating document write-ups, but why stop there?

Skype is a great application for video chatting, calling, and messaging, but it lacks interaction with members. Trello is a great way to organize tasks for anything, but it lacks a real-time communication feature. It is very hard to coordinate with members without a form of communication, so members often find redundant board posts. Google Docs is greatly appreciated, but functionality stops at chatting and documentation editing and leaves key features that would simulate a more attractive meeting.

kord.io is focused on communication and collaboration, we want to help facilitate the dividing line that separates the physical from the digital. The team at kord.io introduces our web application platform that will incorporate the video and text messaging of Skype, the board of Trello, the real-time collaboration of Google docs, and a collaborative "table" all into one easy to use platform. Being able to remove the hassle of micromanaging different programs for different functions will greatly streamline a meeting, announcement, group project, or just a friendly hangout.
