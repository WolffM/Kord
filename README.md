<h2 id="a1">Project Overview</h2>  

Our project will be composed of two major components. The first and most basic is its chat functionality.
Users will be able to chat through text, audio, or video calls. The revolutionary portion of the project is the 'board'.

Basically, the project is a digital whiteboard. Users can draw on it and other members of the group
will be able to see what was drawn in real time. But more than that, users can drag and drop resources onto it,
such as videos, pdfs, text files, etc. Users can then watch videos, annotate a pdf, edit a text file together, and more.

One major feature would be the dynamic logging system. The platform would save not just a history of the chat, but also
of the board. Users who were unable to attend a meeting, could get caught up by watching the history of the board,
as if someone had recorded a video of it. But even more, users would be able to interact with the pieces of board as it played out.

It offers people an environment to share ideas - to interact in an intuitive and flexible way.

<h2 id="a2">Original Proposal</h2>  

There is currently no platform that facilitates robust, real-time discussion and collaboration.
Solutions such as Google Docs, Trello, and Skype do not allow for both simultaneously.
Thus a combination of productivity, organization, and communication software is required to host a digital meeting comfortably.

Our product streamlines the digital meeting by offering communication, productivity, and organizational tools in one app.
It is a digital work space that a group can see and interact with in real time.
Users can drag and drop resources onto the work space like they would physical resources at a meeting.

Once you create a board, importing a picture or video into the board requires that you click on the icon > insert url, > left click on to the white canvas. Removing elements requires a double left click on it. If you run into problems, a simple refresh will bypass most of them.
Instructions on how to draw can be found by clicking on the pencil icon below the logo.
