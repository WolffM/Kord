##Original Proposal

There is currently no platform that facilitates robust, real-time discussion and collaboration.
Solutions such as Google Docs, Trello, and Skype do not allow for both simultaneously.
Thus a combination of productivity, organization, and communication software is required to host a digital meeting comfortably.

Our product streamlines the digital meeting by offering communication, productivity, and organizational tools in one app.
It is a digital work space that a group can see and interact with in real time.
Users can drag and drop resources onto the work space like they would physical resources at a meeting.

More information regarding our original proposal can be found in the /docs/proposal directory. The proposal document contains
member biographies and roles, the problem statement, a product description, a time line, and estimated costs

###Product Description

In order to offer productivity, communication, and organization in a single package,
our product will be composed of two major components. The first and most basic is its chat functionality.
Users will be able to chat through text, audio, or video calls. The revolutionary portion of the project is the 'board'.

Basically, the board is a digital whiteboard. Users can draw on it and other members of the group
will be able to see what was drawn in real time. But more than that, users can drag and drop resources onto it,
such as videos, pdfs, text files, etc. Users can then watch videos, annotate a pdf, edit a text file together, and more.

One major feature would be the dynamic logging system. The platform would save not just a history of the chat, but also
of the board. Users who were unable to attend a meeting, could get caught up by watching the history of the board,
as if someone had recorded a video of it. But even more, users would be able to interact with the pieces of board as it played out, as if
they were present for the actual meeting.

This is perfect for students who often have issues with scheduling meetings and thus inevitably meet digitally.
Imagine the frustration of students working on math homework disappearing as they just write their equations
down as if they were next to each other, working on the same white board. Imagine two students reviewing each other's essays before submission,
and more than that, marking up the documents and discussing ideas and comments in real time. Then suppose a day later, neither one of
them had written down their thoughts. They can come back to this web app and find all of their
notes where they had left them, as if they had left their notes in a physical room.

Or imagine a college professor preparing,
instead of a screen cast because he was temporarily out of commission due to illness,
his lecture through this web app. He can record a screen cast, while streaming video from his web cam. He can present a pdf,
while making annotations on it in real time. Students can watch the lecture as if they were actually in the room, watching the lecture.

That is the power of this project. It offers people an environment to share ideas - to interact in an intuitive and flexible way.
It removes the need for micromanaging multiple windows. It let's people interact as they normally would.
