##Original Proposal

Lacking an environment that facilitates robust, real-time discussion and collaboration.
Current solutions such as Google Docs, Trello, and Skype do not allow for both simultaneously.
A combination of productivity, organization, and communication software is required to host a digital meeting comfortably.

Streamlines the digital meeting by offering communication, productivity, and organizational tools in one app.
A digital work space that the group can see and interact with in real time.
Drag and drop resources onto the work space like you would physical resources at a meeting.

###Description:

Take Trello, Google Docs, a whiteboard, and Skype. The union of these would be
our platform in its simplest form. The goal is to create a central hub for
any sort of communication or collaboration, whether that means students doing
homework, professors giving lectures, businesses holding meetings,
gamers organizing groups, programmers debugging code, etc.

At its core, there would be two major pieces: the actual chat window,
and then what will temporarily be referred to as the ‘table’.

In its most basic usage, the platform would serve as a glorified chat room.
Users can come and go as they please. There would be voice chat and
webcam support in the same way Skype or Google Hangouts already offers.

However, the unique part is the table. The table is a synchronized workspace
that specific or all members of the room have access to. It can hold and
display resources such as text, pictures, audio, or videos
(whether embedded or in the form of URL). Not only will it serve as
a bulletin board for various media, users can draw on it as if it is a whiteboard.
This allows for a truly dynamic and robust communication experience.
Two friends can post a picture of a cross word puzzle and work on it together,
filling in the words as they go. Users can watch videos together,
making annotations as they see fit, etc.

Another key feature would be the logging system. Not only
would the platform save a history of the chat on the cloud, it would also
save a history of the table. This allows users to get caught up on a meeting
by simply watching the meeting over again as if someone had recorded a video of it.
The benefit of this is the user can watch all the pieces come together in real time,
rather than only seeing the final product.

Not only that, but the system would be dynamic - users would be able
to pause the video, and interact with the pieces on the table at any time.
Users can also allow for the information to persist between sessions so groups
can come and go as they please, while their information stays similar to Trello.
