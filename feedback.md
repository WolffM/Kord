You've definitely hit on a great idea!

For this assignment this is exactly what we're looking for.

It's apparent from trello that you're communicating with each other regularly and keeping up.  I haven't seen any commits related to the next project, which is due in a couple of days: it might be a good idea to use a highly iterative development style for this and push commits early and often.

Also, remember to meet weekly (in person or online is fine) and post meeting notes in the notes/ directory of your repo.

Keep up the good work!

THUMBS UP!
