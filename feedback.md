# Project 2 Feedback

The idea of integrating chat, whiteboard, and Google Docs is a great one.  The problem statement does a great job of integrating the integrative experience component.

The timeline and budget are well-detailed; This isn't surprising as the meeting notes, and trello are indicating a fairly high level of engagement from your team members.  Most of you are committing regularly, but I'm wondering if there's a git/github issue with Matthaus?

I'm looking forward to reading the functional specification to see how you're going to do this.

THUMBS UP!

# Project 1 Feedback

You've definitely hit on a great idea!

For this assignment this is exactly what we're looking for.

It's apparent from trello that you're communicating with each other regularly and keeping up.  I haven't seen any commits related to the next project, which is due in a couple of days: it might be a good idea to use a highly iterative development style for this and push commits early and often.

Also, remember to meet weekly (in person or online is fine) and post meeting notes in the notes/ directory of your repo.

Keep up the good work!

THUMBS UP!
